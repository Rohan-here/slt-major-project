Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that might be with me, will be counted stolen.""᛫So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me."
152,2550,"Laban said, ""Behold, let it be according to your word.""᛫And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word."

152,2585,"Laban said to Jacob, ""What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?᛫And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?"
152,2586,"Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn't tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp;᛫Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?"
152,2587,and didn't allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly.᛫And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.
152,2588,"It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Take heed to yourself that you don't speak to Jacob either good or bad.'᛫It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad."
152,2589,"Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father's house, but why have you stolen my gods?""᛫And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?"
152,2590,"Jacob answered Laban, ""Because I was afraid, for I said, 'Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.'᛫And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me."
152,2591,"Anyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it."" For Jacob didn't know that Rachel had stolen them.᛫With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them."

What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me?᛫And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?"
152,2596,"Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.᛫Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both."

152,2601,"Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.""᛫Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight."
